A trivial example showing constexpr with static_assert


Building
========

The buildWithClang36.sh script uses Clang++ 3.6 to build the file, passing in flags to enable sophisticated constexpr support.

The program has not been tested on other platforms, but it should be trivial to adapt the build to g++.
